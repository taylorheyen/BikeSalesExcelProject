Bike Sales Excel Project

This was a guided project by AlexTheAnalyst on Youtube (<https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst>).

The project took Bike Sales data that included attributes such as Age, Gender, Region, Income, Education, and other clarifying attributes.

We initially cleaned the data in a separate worksheet

We then created pivot tables and charts and graphs based on those pivot tables

And finally we took the charts and graphs and organized them better into a dashboard. Once the dashboard was organized better we added spliceâ€™s for the charts so we could further filter our charts
